# My Hobbies Page

## Planning
I decided to make a travel blog for teachers based on places I had visited. 
I first tried out some different looks and layouts before settling on how I wanted the page to look.
I decided to have a section for each part of the year and would base my advice around
school holiday time. To maitain some consistency throughout the page, I decided
each section would contain a title, a list of when/how long/activity level, 
2 images, a short intro and a list of must-dos or extra info.

## Building
To start building my site I made some place holder elements for one section. 
I then copy and pasted these into each section so that they would be the same. 
Initially I hadn't worked out exactly how I wanted images and text displayed.
I tried round images in the sections but thought they looked a bit odd next to the text.

As I changed my mind and decided on a slightly altered layout, using flexbox display,
I had to create some new placeholder text for each section.

I left most of the responsiveness until I had finished adding content, in case I 
changed anything else.

## Debugging
I spent some time getting the responsive design right. The photos were too big for each section and would not display how I wanted them to.

responsiveness
getting links central
