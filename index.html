  <h2>Autumn</h2>
  <p>That first half term at school can be pretty exhausting! 
    You <em>could</em> spend your holiday catching up on school 
    work and lying on the sofa, but why not get away and forget
    about work for a week? Whether you'd prefer to stay in the
    UK or head further afield, there are some great options for
    you!

            Visit Mauritius for diverse wildlife,

            You can find cheaper stays as well as all-inclusive resorts, if you're not looking
            to break the bank! Expect hot weather at this time of year. 
            If you prefer it a bit cooler, visit in August. The island is quite large, so I recommend
            hiring a car to maximise your exploring potential.

            Word of warning: it is hurricane season at this time

            while you are there and take advice from locals. warnings
            aside, if you are looking for adventure, nature, getting off
            the beaten track, history, local flavour... (I could go on!),

                Make the most of your trip and visit at least

              My trip to Nicaragua was one of the best I have been on.
              I visited in 2019 when they were just recovering from 
              a lot of civil unrest. There were not many tourists around so you
              really felt like we were off the beaten track. There is everything there,
              from rainforests, to volcanoes, to caribbean islands. 
            </p>
            <p>
                See some colonial architecture and hike a volcano in Leon...
                go canoeing or climb a volcano on the island of Omotepe... eat 
                lobster and bathe in crystal clear waters
                on the Corn Islands... or surf and party in San Juan; 
                Nicaragua has it all. 
            </p>
